# Hospital Management System

A hospital management system is an essential tool for managing the various functions of a hospital, such as managing staff, employees, rooms, and patients. This system typically includes an admin portal that allows authorized users to add or remove users who can access the system, while users can log in using their unique username and password. The system is designed to provide different dashboards for the three types of users - admin, doctor, and patient - to access the features that they are permitted to, and manage their settings.

## Features

Some of the key features of a hospital management system are:

- **Doctor and Patient Records:** This feature allows you to store and manage records of doctors and patients. It includes details such as personal information, medical history, and contact information.

- **Prescription Management:** The prescription management feature allows doctors to generate and manage prescriptions for their patients. This feature also allows patients to view their prescriptions online.

- **Appointments Management:** This feature allows doctors to manage their appointments with patients. Patients can view their appointment schedules online and can book, reschedule or cancel appointments as needed.

- **Billing Details:** The billing details feature enables you to manage the billing and invoicing for the hospital's services, including insurance claims.

- **Patient History:** This feature enables doctors to access the complete medical history of a patient, including past diagnoses, treatments, and medications.
